            <p>
                This course was designed by <a href="http://siat.andrewh.ca/">Andrew Hawryshkewich</a> and much of the content is taken (with his permission) from his website <a href="http://iat235.andrewh.ca/2015/spring/">IAT 235 - Spring '15</a>. You can go there if you need supplemental information.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have made my own modifications to hopefully improve the course and try out some new IA ideas and challenges.

                There are three projects in the course this term, which build upon one another; the first one defines the context and scope of your project, the second concludes with wireframing, and the third with a complete HTML/CSS mockup of a website. Projects are completed in groups of three, unless special permission is given by Andrew. All project process materials are graded individually.

                All Courses Are Equal
            </h3>
            <p>
                Please remember that all courses are created equal, no one course should monopolize all your time at the detriment of your other courses. If you should find yourself in such a situation, please let your instructor know sooner rather than later.

                Late or Incorrectly Submitted Deliverables
            </h3>
            <p>
                Late deliverables receive 10% per day late starting immediately after the deliverable is due. Allow yourself sufficient time to submit deliverables without incurring late penalties.

                Files incorrectly submitted to Canvas
            </h3>
            <p>
                For example, submitting a PDF that cannot be opened - will receive a penalty on the resubmitted file of 25% plus 10% per day not resubmitted (after the grades have been released). For example, if you do not resubmit the file until two days after the grades are released the penalty will be 45%. It is your responsibility to ensure that your deliverables make it in on-time and in an uncorrupted fashion.

            <p>
                Is not permitted unless under special circumstances. You must first speak with Andrew (mlockyer@sfu.ca), though keep in mind that there must be an opening and nobody on the waitlist to be able to switch labs (often unlikely).

                If your work refers to or builds upon an existing work, you must cite the original in your submission or presentation. Failure to do so will be considered plagiarism.
